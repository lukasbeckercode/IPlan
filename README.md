# IPlan 

####by Lukas Becker
This Programm is, for the most part, a desktop app. A user can log in or register at the welcome screen. Depending on 
the type of user, different options for what a user can do are shown. Admins can add courses and rooms to the System, 
Teachers can wish for a date, time and room to teach and Students can inscribe to different courses. <br /> 
A  Timetable is generated by the program and can be viewed by every type of user. However, Students and Teachers 
only see courses they are associated with while administrators can view every course that exists. 
## Milestones
Date | Description|
---|---|
02.06.|Basic Structure of Objects|
08.06.|Added Swing UI|
11.06.|Added Database Connection and more GUI|
14.06|Added a TimeTable in thymeleaf, fixed Course inscribing issue|

## Design Decisions

I am using a package containing the basic objects used for ORM. <br />
Hibernate is used to store the Data <br /> 
The basic UI is made as a Desktop app using Swing, I am planning to make the actual TimeTable in a website. 
For said website, I finally decided on using ThymeLeaf with SpringBoot. It creates a simple table. 
I might add some css for it later
## TODO
- check Checker class: Testcase Written!  
- add timetable: Thymeleaf added, maybe css?  
- check what assistent entity is
- course wisher isn`t implemented yet
- more responsiveness: threads, message boxes
