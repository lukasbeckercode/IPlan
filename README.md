02.06.|Basic Structure of Objects|
08.06.|Added Swing UI|
11.06.|Added Database Connection and more GUI|
14.06|Added a TimeTable in thymeleaf|

## Design Decisions

I am using a package containing the basic objects used for ORM. <br />
Hibernate is used to store the Data <br /> 
The basic UI is made as a Desktop app using Swing, I am planning to make the actual TimeTable in a website. 
For said website, I finally decided on using ThymeLeaf with SpringBoot. It creates a simple table. 
I might add some css for it later
## TODO
- check Checker class: Testcase Written!  
- Improve new user handling: Kinda done?  
- add timetable: Thymeleaf added, maybe css?  
- check what assistent entity is
- inscribe feature for students not working in Hibernate
- more responsiveness: threads, message boxes
