## Design Decisions

I am using a package containing the basic objects used for ORM. <br />

The basic UI is made as a Desktop app using Swing, I am planning to make the actual TimeTable in a website(Grafana?)
## TODO
- check Checker class: Testcase Written!

- inscribe feature for students not working in Hibernate
